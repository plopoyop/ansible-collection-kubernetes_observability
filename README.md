# Ansible Collection Observability for Kubernetes - plopoyop.kubernetes_observability

## Description

This Ansible collection provides a set of roles to install and configure various observability tools on a Kubernetes cluster using their helm charts. The goal is to simplify and automate the deployment of these tools using Ansible.

## Contents

This collection includes multiple Ansible roles designed to install and configure essential tools for a Kubernetes cluster. Each role is designed to be as configurable as possible while providing default settings tailored to my specific usage.

## Disclaimer

The roles provided in this collection are developed based on my usage of the tools and my specific needs. While configuration options are available to adjust their behavior, not all possible options are necessarily supported.

Before using this collection in production, ensure that the default configurations meet your needs and adjust them if necessary.

## Prerequisites

- Ansible >= 2.9
- A running Kubernetes cluster
- Administrator access to cluster nodes (if required for certain installations)

## Installation

To install this collection, use the following command:

```sh
